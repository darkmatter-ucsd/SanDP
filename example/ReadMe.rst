It's a longstanding issue that GitHub can't render notebook all the time. If you see ```Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?```,
just do the following:

* Go to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
* Copy the notebook website to the text box, such as our notebook, https://github.com/darkmatter-ucsd/SanDP/blob/master/example/data_load_example.ipynb
